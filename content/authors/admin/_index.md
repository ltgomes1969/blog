    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me
I am a student at RUDN. I am from Guinea-Bissau, a country in West Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean. I like anime and manga, as well as oriental culture, especially Korean and Japanese culture, and I am very good at learning other languages.
